# Learning Bash Scripting

This repository contains files for my course, [Learning Bash Scripting](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-bash-scripting-26210777), which is available on LinkedIn Learning.

What's it all about? Here's the course description:

> "Bash is a popular command line interpreter, and it’s the default option on most Linux distributions. If you spend much time working with Linux, you’re bound to come across it time and time again. If you do any kind of Linux administration, you’ll find yourself creating and using bash scripts frequently. In this course, Scott Simpson explains how to create a script, make it executable, and run it. Scott takes you through programming tasks, dives into Bash control structures, and highlights how to interact with the user. Plus, he shows you how to troubleshoot your scripts. This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the “Following along using GitHub Codespaces” video to learn how to get started."
